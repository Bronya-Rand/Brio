- Fixed a rare crash with the Library.

--- Known issues ---

- On some systems there is a known crash in GPose when Brio is enabled.
	- I am unable to reproduce this if you experience this:
	- Be sure to check your Penumbra mod-lists to make sure no Penumbra mods are broken.
	- If you still experience a crash after checking your Penumbra mods, please report it!

- After using IK, there will be lingering effects to other bones after Disabling IK.

- When the `Advanced Pose` or `Transform Editor` Window is certain sizes and
  more than one `Transform Tab` is open, the `Transform Editor` glitches.
	- Workaround:
		- close all but one `Transform Tab`, or...
		- change the size of the `Advanced Pose` or `Transform Editor` Window.
